sortOfFtp.js
============

Maybe "minimalistic file manager" is a better description

## What it is:
sortOfFtp.js is a file manager on the web which uses nothing, but your email-address as authorization.
It does this by using a facebook app which returns the email-address of the user who authenticated the app.
I don't know, if this is a really secure way of authorization but it works.

## What it let's you do:
It let's you browse, upload and delete files with the permissions of the user running the app -- through a web interface.
And by minimalistic i mean minimalistic.

## How to Run it:
Edit the config.js to your liking and hit `node app`
For better understandment of the config-file, have a look at [config.js](config.js)
